code-repair-series
==================

Refactoring and improving existing code can be tough. It's a process that takes some time to learn.
The code repair series is a series of tutorial posts where I attempt to take existing pieces
of code and show people the step by step process involved in improving that code.

These tutorial posts can be found here: http://www.lesinskis.com/code_repair.html

Given that refactoring can be a long process it makes sense to keep the code in version control.
This repository is for the code in those articles.
